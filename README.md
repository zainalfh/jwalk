**Live Demo:** [https://jwalk.netlify.app/](https://jwalk.netlify.app/)

A Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to guide users through the **Japanese Walking Method** (Interval Walking Training - IWT), a scientific approach to boost metabolism, cardiovascular health, and leg strength.

## 🌟 Features

*   **Interval Timer**: Automatically alternates between **3 minutes of fast walking** and **3 minutes of slow walking**.
*   **Audio Cues**: 
    *   Distinct metronome ticks for fast (higher pitch) vs. slow (lower pitch) pacing.
    *   Gong sounds for phase transitions.
    *   Boxing bell signals session completion.
    *   Mute toggle for silent practice.
*   **Pedometer**: Uses device motion sensors to count steps during the session.
*   **History Log**: Saves your sessions locally to track progress over time.
*   **Offline Capable**: Fully functional PWA that works without an internet connection.
*   **Education**: Learn the history and technique behind Dr. Hiroshi Nose's research.
